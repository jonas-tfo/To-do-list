A simple text editor with multiple tabs, which can be used as a to-do list. The application auto saves any input text and auto retrieves the text when the window is opened. This means that no manual saving or importing of text is needed, but there are "Save as" and "Open file" options for exporting and importing text to and from files.

Features:
- Multiple tabs for sorting topics
- automatic startup (imports the text that was present the last time the window was open)
- autosave (automatically saves the text from each tab)
- Open file button for importing text
- Save as button for saving text to a file
